## Project requierments 

You must make a single page application (only one index.html file) using create-react-app.

Your app should use at least 3 components in a way that keeps your code well organized.

There should be at least 2 client-side routes using React RouterLinks to an external site.. Be sure to include a nav bar or other UI element that allows users to navigate between routes.

Use a json-server to create a RESTful API for your backend and make both a GET and a POST request to the json server. Use a form to make your post request, specifically a controlled form/component. Additionally, you may choose to incorporate data from an external API but it is not required.

You should keep your json-server data simple: avoid nested data and associations. You'll learn how to work with more complex data in the next two phases. Focus on the frontend for this project.
Upon return of json from your POST request, a state update by a setState function is required!
